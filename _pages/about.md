Hello! I am Soham Jana, a 5th year Doctoral Candidate the dept. of Statistics and Data Science , Yale University. My research typically focusses on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of minimum distance estimation, Empirical Bayes and analysis of Markov chains. During my time in Yale , I have been fortunately mentored by [Prof. Yihong Wu](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~yw562/).

Prior to this, I finished my Bachelors of Statistics(B.Stat.) and Masters of Statistic(M.Stat) from Indian Statistical Institute(ISI), Kolkata. The focal point of my Masters dissertation happened to be analyzing minimum distance estimators that can avoid Kernel smoothing in estimation process. My work was completed under the guidance of [Prof. Ayanendranath Basu](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ayanbasu/), ISI Kolkata.
