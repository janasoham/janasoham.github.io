<span style='color:grey'>About me</span>
-----------------------------------------

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics (ACMS) at the University of Notre Dame, IN, USA. 

Previously, I was a Post-doctoral Research Associate at Princeton ORFE, where I have been fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jianqing Fan](https://fan.princeton.edu/) and [Prof. Sanjeev Kulkarni](https://www.princeton.edu/~kulkarni/). I finished my Ph.D. at the [Department of Statistics and Data Science, Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu/). During my doctoral studies at Yale, I have been fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Yihong Wu](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~yw562/). Prior to this, I spent five wonderful years at [Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/), completing my Bachelors of Statistics (B.Stat.) and Masters of Statistics (M.Stat.) with specialization in Theoretical Statistics. For my Master's dissertation, I worked on minimum distance estimators that can avoid Kernel smoothing in the estimation process, under the guidance of [Prof. Ayanendranath Basu](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ayanbasu/).
