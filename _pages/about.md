Hello! I am a 5th year Doctoral candidat at the dept. of Statistics and Data Science , Yale University. My research typically focusses on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of minimum distance estimation, Empirical Bayes and analysis of Markov chains. During my time at Yale, I have been fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Yihong Wu](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~yw562/).

Prior to this, I finished my Bachelors of Statistics (B.Stat.) and Masters of Statistics (M.Stat.) from Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata. The focal point of my Masters dissertation was analyzing minimum distance estimators that can avoid Kernel smoothing in estimation process. My work was completed under the guidance of [Prof. Ayanendranath Basu](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ayanbasu/), ISI Kolkata.
