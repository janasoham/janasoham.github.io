I am a 5th year Doctoral candidate at the Department of Statistics and Data Science, Yale University. My current research focusses broadly on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of Staistics and Machine learning, in particular minimum distance estimation, Empirical Bayes and analysis of Markov chains. During my time at Yale I have been fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Yihong Wu](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~yw562/).

Prior to this I spent a wonderful five years at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, where I finished my Bachelors of Statistics (B.Stat.) and Masters of Statistics (M.Stat.), with specialization on Theoretical Statistics. The topic of my Masters dissertation was analysis of minimum distance estimators that can avoid Kernel smoothing in estimation process. My work was completed under the watchful guidance of [Prof. Ayanendranath Basu](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ayanbasu/).
