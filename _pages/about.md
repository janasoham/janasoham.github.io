## About me

I am a fifth year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Statistics and Data Science, Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu/). During my doctoral studies at Yale, I have been fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Yihong Wu](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~yw562/). 

Prior to this, I spent five wonderful years at [Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/), completing my Bachelors of Statistics (B.Stat.) and Masters of Statistics (M.Stat.) with specialization in Theoretical Statistics. For my Master's dissertation, I worked on minimum distance estimators that can avoid Kernel smoothing in the estimation process, under the watchful guidance of [Prof. Ayanendranath Basu](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ayanbasu/).

In Fall 2022 I will join Princeton ORFE as a Postdoctoral Research Associate under the supervision of [Prof. Sanjeev Kulkarni](https://www.princeton.edu/~kulkarni/).

## Research interests

I am broadly interested in theoretical and methodological aspects of Statistics and Machine learning, including

* High dimensional problems
* Non-parametric estimation
* Markov decision process
* Mixture modeling
* Federated learning 
* Non-convex penalties
* Support recovery
