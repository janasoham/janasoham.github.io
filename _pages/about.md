## About me

I am a PhD student at the Department of Statistics and Data Science, Yale University. I will be entering my 5th year in Fall 2021. During my doctoral studies at Yale I have been fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Yihong Wu](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~yw562/). 

Prior to this I spent five wonderful years at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata completing my Bachelors of Statistics (B.Stat.) and Masters of Statistics (M.Stat.) with specialization on Theoretical Statistics. For my Masters dissertation I worked on minimum distance estimators that can avoid Kernel smoothing in estimation process, under watchful guidance of [Prof. Ayanendranath Basu](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ayanbasu/).

## Research interests

I am broadly interested in theoretical and algorithmic aspects of Statistics and Machine learning. My works as of now include
* Minimax estimation
* Minimum distance estimators
* Empirical Bayes
* Profile estimation
* Markov chains of finite order
* Spectral analysis
* Linear models with sparsity constraints
