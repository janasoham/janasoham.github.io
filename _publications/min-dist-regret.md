title: "Regret optimality of minimum distance estimators in certain class of Poisson mixtures"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/min-dist-regret
excerpt: "We consider the Poisson mean model and construct a class of minimum distaance estimators that achieve optimal excess
regret over the Bayes estimator, which is unknown in absense of knowledge about the prior distribution. These estimators also exhibit superior
performance over usual Robbins method in real and simulated dataset."
