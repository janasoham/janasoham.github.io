excerpt: "We consider the Poisson mean model and construct a class of minimum distaance estimators that achieve optimal excess
regret over the Bayes estimator, which is unknown in absense of knowledge about the prior distribution. These estimators also exhibit superior
performance over usual Robbins method in real and simulated dataset."

Abstract:
=========

The Poisson model with certain mixture distributions on the mean parameter is considered.
Extending the work of [PW21] we provide a class of minimum distance estimators, which includes
the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator, that achieves minimax optimal regret over
oracle estimator (posterior mean) when the mixture distribution is either (a) supported on a
bounded interval of constant length or (b) within the class of sub-exponential distributions with
constant parameters.
