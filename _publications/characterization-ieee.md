title: "A characterization of all single-integral, non-kernel divergence estimators"

collection: publications

permalink: /publication/characterization-non-kernel

excerpt: 'In this work, we provide a characterization of the class of divergences that
bypasses the use of non-parametric smoothing in the construction of divergences, leading to faster rate of estimation 
in practical computational purposes.'
