title: "On consistency of stochastic gates in sparsed support recovery problems"
collection: workingpapers
permalink: /working-papers/stg
excerpt: "We show the given independent data generated from linear models with properly spaced sparsed parameter vector, the estimators based on Stochastic gates 
consistently estimates the support. We demonstrate with synthetic data the superiority of our method over many classical estimators in small sample regime."
